# Project Euler

My solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems up to problem 100. I don't (yet!) have many beyond this level.

# About the Solutions

_Almost_ everything here is my own work. To explain the naming, "e14.py" is my first attempt at problem 14, "e14-2.py" is my second attempt, with a different algorithm, but "e14-taujiong.py" is my implementation of an algorithm by a Project Euler user called taujiong.

# Why Now?

Publishing solutions was frowned upon in the past. Lately they have updated their boilerplate text on getting an answer right:

We hope that you enjoyed solving this problem. Please do not deprive others of going through the same process by publishing your solution outside of Project Euler. Members found to be spoiling problems beyond #100 will have their accounts locked (see note).

If you are keen to share your insights and/or wish to see how other members have solved the problem, then please visit thread 41 in our private discussion forum.

Note: The rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first 100 problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for them to be discussed elsewhere.
